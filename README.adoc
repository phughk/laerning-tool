== Introduction

Laerning Tool is an API that provides access to learning environments.
This is useful for various scenarios

Obvious scholarly uses:
- learning languages
- learning topics (such as electro dynamics)
- learning maps
- learning geo-policital statistics
- learning historic events

Non-obvious uses:
- learning rules to a complex game
- learning a style of writing
- fun quizes
- reinforcing process or excercises ("how to build and deploy this project", "how to remember the flow of thought for a presentation")
- reinforcing the key points from books you read

There are many more.
Any time you would have said "ah, I should put some effort into getting better at this!", this should be the answer.
And the datasets should be available online so others can use the data created!
